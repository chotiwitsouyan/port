                    <h4>This job in brief : </h4>
                    <p>Software developers implement software solutions by building programs, applications and websites. They write and test code, often using development tools. The work can involve talking to clients and colleagues to assess and define what solution of system is needed, which means there is a lot of interaction as well as technical work. A computing, software engineering or related degree is often needed but a few employers train up other graduates who can demonstrate interest in and aptitude for software development.</p>

                    <h4>This job in brief :</h4>
                    <p>IT support analysts provide technical set-up, support and advice to IT users via email, phone, social media and in person. They either provide support within a particular organisation or to external businesses, customers of a particular product or on an ad hoc basis. For example, there is a growing market for on-demand services for home and office tech repair, set-up and troubleshooting. While open to graduates of any discipline, technical support employers typically prefer graduates with an IT-related degree.</p>
